# glivedisk
A simple python module for gentoo live disk building


Why create this project instead of using catalyst?

1. as a pure library, not utility, especially no configuration files
2. create rescue os, rescue disk and live disk. catalyst can only create the latter two
3. use pkgwh instead of portage (in future)
4. use bbki instead of genkernel (in future)
